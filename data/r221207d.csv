The crash has served as a cautionary reminder that finance cannot be trustless and stable at the same time. Trust cannot be replaced by religious faith in an algorithm. It requires transparency, regulatory safeguards and scrutiny."
19,r221207d,"Does this mean we are witnessing the endgame for crypto? Probably not. People like to gamble. On horse races, football games and many other events. And some investors will continue to gamble by taking speculative positions on crypto-assets."
20,r221207d,Today I will argue that the fundamental flaws of crypto-assets mean that they can quickly collapse when irrational exuberance subsides. We should therefore focus on protecting inexperienced investors and preserving the stability of the financial system.

25,r221207d,"The philosophy behind cryptos is that digital technology can replace regulated intermediaries and avoid state “intrusion”. In other words, that it is possible to build a trustless but stable financial system based on technology."
26,r221207d,"This is just an illusion, as was clear from the outset and confirmed by recent developments. In fact, it is precisely the absence of regulation and public scrutiny that blinded investors to the risks involved, leading to the rise and subsequent fall of crypto-assets."
27,r221207d,The risks associated with crypto finance stem from three fundamental flaws. I will address each of them in turn.

119,r221207d,"Gambling is perhaps the second oldest profession in the world. It has been traced back to ancient China, Greece and Rome. People have always gambled in different ways: casting lots, rolling dice, betting on animals or playing cards. And in the digital era I expect them to continue gambling by taking speculative positions on crypto-assets."
120,r221207d,"We therefore need to mitigate the risks, while harnessing the innovative potential of digital finance beyond cryptos. There are two elements to this."
121,r221207d,Regulating crypto-assets
122,r221207d,The first is to regulate crypto-assets and ensure that they do not benefit from preferential treatment compared with other assets.[
123,r221207d,28
124,r221207d,]
125,r221207d,The recent failures of crypto entities do not seem to have had a material impact on the financial sector. But they have highlighted the immense potential for economic and social damage if we leave cryptos unchecked.[ especially as major tech companies enter the sector.
126,r221207d,"] And the links between the crypto market and the financial system may become stronger,"
127,r221207d,29
128,r221207d,That is why we now need – urgently – to regulate crypto-assets. It is crucial that the regulatory frameworks currently in the legislative process quickly enter into force and start being implemented so that words can be followed by deeds.
129,r221207d,Addressing financial risks
130,r221207d,"Regulators must walk a tightrope. For one, they need to build guardrails to tackle regulatory gaps and arbitrage. But they also need to avoid legitimising unsound crypto models and refrain from socialising the risks through bailouts.["
131,r221207d,30
132,r221207d,]
133,r221207d,"Regulatory efforts should primarily be directed at preventing the use of crypto-assets as a way of circumventing financial regulation.

MiCA will regulate stablecoins, crypto-assets other than stablecoins, and crypto- asset service providers. It will subject stablecoin issuers of e-money tokens[ tokens[ to contain their risks.

Given the time needed to design and apply new legislation, it is important to empower regulators, overseers and supervisors to adjust their instruments to keep pace with market and technological developments."
144,r221207d,"The ECB is not responsible for regulating investment activities. But we are responsible for overseeing European payment systems, and we have already taken action in this field. Our oversight framework for payment instruments, schemes and arrangements – the PISA framework – that was launched last year addresses the risks of stablecoins and other crypto-assets for payment systems."
145,r221207d,"Since crypto-assets know no borders, their regulatory framework must be global. This requires rapid implementation of the Financial Stability Board’s recommendations to make the regulatory, supervisory and oversight approaches to crypto activities consistent and comprehensive across different countries.[ Swift progress is also needed to finalise the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s framework for the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset activities."

164,r221207d,"But even regulation would not be enough to provide a stable basis for digital finance. The second factor at play here is that, in order to harness the opportunities offered by technological innovation, we need to give digital finance – like other forms of finance – an anchor of stability in the form of a digital risk-free asset."
165,r221207d,Only central bank money can provide an anchor of stability
166,r221207d,Some commentators are of the view that adequate regulation would allow stablecoins to provide such a risk-free asset. This is a misconception.
167,r221207d,"Stablecoins invest their reserve assets in market instruments, which inevitably exposes them to several risks: liquidity, credit, counterparty and operational risks. Prudent investment policies can reduce but not eliminate such risks. The riskiness of stablecoins will over time lead to them being traded at variable prices, making them unsuitable as risk-free assets."
168,r221207d,Risks could theoretically be eliminated by allowing full-reserve – or narrow – stablecoins to hold their reserve assets entirely in the form of risk-free deposits at the central bank. This would avoid custody and investment risks for stablecoins and underpin their commitment to reimburse coin holders at par value at all times.
169,r221207d,"But other fundamental problems would then emerge. In fact, this would be tantamount to outsourcing the provision of central bank money. It could even threaten monetary sovereignty if a stablecoin were to largely displace sovereign money. And narrow stablecoins could divert sizeable deposits away from banks, with potential adverse consequences for the financing of the real economy.["

171,r221207d,]
172,r221207d,Only central bank money can provide an anchor of stability. The solution is to extend today’s two-tier monetary system into the digital age. This system is built on the complementary roles of central bank money and commercial bank money.
173,r221207d,"Central bank money is currently available for retail use in only physical form – cash. But the digitalisation of payments is eroding the role of cash and its ability to provide an effective monetary anchor. Central bank digital currencies would instead preserve the use of public money for digital retail payments. By offering a digital, risk-free common denominator, a central bank digital currency would facilitate convertibility among different forms of private digital money. It would thus preserve the singleness of money and protect monetary sovereignty. The ECB is working on a digital euro precisely for these reasons.["

175,r221207d,]
176,r221207d,"To preserve its crucial role, public money must also continue to be used as a settlement asset for wholesale financial transactions.["
177,r221207d,44
178,r221207d,]
179,r221207d,"The Eurosystem currently provides settlement in central bank money for wholesale transactions with its TARGET services.

Whether such a scenario will materialise is uncertain, but we must be ready to respond if it does. Our response may include making central bank money available for wholesale"

183,r221207d,"By ensuring that the role of central bank money as the anchor of the payment system is preserved for both retail and wholesale transactions, central banks will safeguard the trust on which private forms of money ultimately depend."
184,r221207d,Conclusion
185,r221207d,"Let me conclude. Born in the depths of the global financial crisis, crypto-assets were portrayed as a generational phenomenon, promising to bring about radical change in how we pay, save and invest. Instead, they have become the bubble of a generation. It is now obvious to everyone that the promise of easy crypto-money and high returns was a bubble doomed to burst. It turns out that crypto-assets are not money. Many are just a new way of gambling."
186,r221207d,"There is an urgent need globally for regulation to protect consumers from the risks of crypto-assets, define minimum requirements for crypto firms’ risk management and corporate governance, and reduce the run and contagion risks of stablecoins. We should also tax crypto-assets according to their social costs."
187,r221207d,"But regulation will not turn risky instruments into safe money. Instead, a stable digital finance ecosystem requires well-supervised intermediaries and a risk-free and dependable digital settlement asset, which only digital central bank money can provide."
