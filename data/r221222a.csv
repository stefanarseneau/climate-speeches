1,r221222a,"(Address by Shri M. Rajeshwar Rao, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India - "
2,r221222a,"December 22, 2022 - at the Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit) "
3,r221222a,1.  A very good morning to all the distinguished dignitaries and participants at 
4,r221222a,this BFSI Insight Summit being organised by the Business Standard. I am 
5,r221222a,"very  happy  to  be  amidst  you  today  albeit  virtually.  In  recent  times,  this "
6,r221222a,event has become a well-regarded platform for debate and deliberation on 
7,r221222a,contemporary issues in finance and has generated useful insights from the 
8,r221222a,wisdom of distinguished speakers who have graced the previous summits.  
9,r221222a,"2.  As we look back over the past decade and a half, what is really striking is "
10,r221222a,the  fact  that  the  financial  sector  has  been  buffeted  by  several  financial 
11,r221222a,"storms which it has bravely weathered. After each episode, the endeavour "
12,r221222a,had  been  to  ensure  that  the  institutions  emerge  stronger  and  more 
13,r221222a,"resilient, so as to support the continuing narrative of recovery and growth. "
14,r221222a,The  episodes  of  crisis  of  late  have  become  more  frequent  with  lesser 
15,r221222a,"breathing  space  afforded  to  the  institutions  to  recover,  recoup  and  be "
16,r221222a,future ready. The evolving situation demands that both the regulators and 
17,r221222a,the  regulated  entities  remain  ever  ready  and  well  equipped  to  face  the 
18,r221222a,"emerging  challenges,  be  it  the  growth  of  fintech,  digitalisation  of  financial "
19,r221222a,"services,  customer  service  or  the  challenges  of  cybersecurity  in  the "
20,r221222a,financial  services  sector.  But  the  key  risk  which  I  would  like  to  discuss 
21,r221222a,today is the impact of climate change and what it can mean for the financial 
22,r221222a,services industry. In a way I am revisiting a topic on which I spoke about a 
23,r221222a,year  back2  -  climate  risk  and  green  finance.  While  this  issue  may  still  be 
24,r221222a,the  new  kid  on  the  block  as  far  as  the  deliberations  in  such  financial 
25,r221222a,"gatherings  are  concerned,  it  is  fast  becoming  a  key  issue  which  is  being "
26,r221222a,discussed globally and the urgency of the situation is more apparent to one 
27,r221222a,and all.

30,r221222a,                                                                 3.   The  recent  Conference  of  Parties  (COP-27)  Summit  in  Egypt  and  the 
31,r221222a,United  Nations  Environment  Programme’s  ‘Emissions  Gap  Report  2022  - 
32,r221222a,The Closing Window’ released in October 20223 have once again brought 
33,r221222a,to fore global attention on the measures required and the need for urgent 
34,r221222a,action. The hierarchy of actions and the agencies responsible for the same 
35,r221222a,is getting crystallised while there is a greater degree of agreement on the 
36,r221222a,manner in which to proceed further starting from taking effective steps for 
37,r221222a,"reducing carbon emissions, to fostering sustainable patterns of production "
38,r221222a,and  consumption  and  transitioning  to  a  sustainable  lifestyle  in  a  cleaner 
39,r221222a,and greener earth. It is also clear that there is no room for differences on 
40,r221222a,the  issue  and  only  our  collective  efforts  can  address  the  challenge  of 
41,r221222a,climate change.  
42,r221222a,"4.  Having  said  that,  the  question  that  emerges  is  what  would  be  the  role  of "
43,r221222a,different  institutions  in  achieving  these  objectives?  While  the  overarching 
44,r221222a,policy approach would be guided by sovereign efforts and coordinated by 
45,r221222a,"decision-making bodies such as the COP, the financial world needs to ask "
46,r221222a,the obvious question to itself - how can we help? As custodians of financial 
47,r221222a,"stability,  central  banks  and  policymakers  would  also  be  required  to "
48,r221222a,evaluate  and  examine  the  instruments  or  strategies  they  should  leverage 
49,r221222a,or  focus  upon  to  meet  sustainability  goals  without  compromising  on  their 
50,r221222a,existing policy mandates. These are some of the dilemmas that I would like 
51,r221222a,to highlight today in my remarks. 
52,r221222a,"5.  Given its wide ranging economic and financial implications, climate-related "
53,r221222a,financial risks are already engaging the attention of international standard 
54,r221222a,"setting  bodies,  central  banks,  and  supervisors  globally  with  the  focus  on "
55,r221222a,the  need  to  promote  the  transition  to  a  sustainable  global  economy.  The 
56,r221222a,Reserve Bank too had come out with a Discussion Paper4 on Climate Risk 
57,r221222a,"and  Sustainable  Finance  earlier  this  year.  Besides,  RBI  had  also "
58,r221222a,undertaken  a  Survey  on  Climate  Risk  and  Sustainable  Finance  among 
59,r221222a,3 The report can be accessed at https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022   4 Reserve Bank of India - Press Releases (rbi.org.in) 
60,r221222a,2 
61,r221222a,                                                                 leading  scheduled  commercial  banks.  There  is  a  general  consensus  that 
62,r221222a,banks and financial institutions will play a key role in financing the transition 
63,r221222a,to  a 
64,r221222a,low-carbon  economy  and  supporting 
65,r221222a,the  national  climate 
66,r221222a,commitments.   
67,r221222a,"6.  While  no  entity  is  immune  from  climate  risks,  we  in  India  are  particularly "
68,r221222a,vulnerable to the climate change related physical risks5  and hence there is 
69,r221222a,"a need to be more alive to the urgency of action6 given our long coastline, "
70,r221222a,high  share  of 
71,r221222a,fossil 
72,r221222a,fuels 
73,r221222a,"in  energy  systems,  and  relatively  high "
74,r221222a,dependence  of  rural  livelihoods  on  agriculture.  Climate  trends  and  events 
75,r221222a,have  a  direct  bearing  on  the  economy  and  resultantly  have  an  impact  on 
76,r221222a,"the  financial  institutions  and  the  financial  system.    According  to  a  report7, "
77,r221222a,the  transformation  of  the  global  economy  needed  to  achieve  net-zero 
78,r221222a,"emissions by 2050 would be universal and significant, requiring $9.2 trillion "
79,r221222a,"in annual average spending on physical assets, which is $3.5 trillion more "
80,r221222a,"than what is being spent today. In the case of India, the Council on Energy, "
81,r221222a,Environment  and  Water8  has  already  estimated  that  a  total  investment  of 
82,r221222a,US$  10.1  trillion  would  be  needed  to  meet  our  net  zero  commitments  by 
83,r221222a,2070.  This  underscores  the  urgency  of  efforts  for  transitioning  to  a  low 
84,r221222a,carbon  economy.  Ensuring  access  to  adequate  transtition  finance  and 
85,r221222a,supporting technology would be critical in this process.  
86,r221222a,"7.  Going forward, there are two key aspects which banks would need to focus "
87,r221222a,"on - first, relying on their time-tested expertise in financial intermediation by "
88,r221222a,acting  as  an  effective  conduit  for  channelising  finance  to  carbon  efficient 
89,r221222a,sectors  and  industries  in  alignment  with  national  policies  and  goals;  and 
90,r221222a,"second, improving the management of financial risks in  their books which "
91,r221222a,"5 Physical Risks are  economic costs and financial losses resulting from the increasing severity and frequency of:  extreme  climate  change-related  weather  events  (or  extreme  weather  events)  such  as  heatwaves,  landslides,  floods, wildfires and storms (i.e. acute physical risks); longer-term gradual shifts of the climate such as changes  in precipitation, extreme weather variability, ocean acidification, and rising sea levels and average temperatures  (i.e.  chronic  physical  risks  or  chronic  risks);  and    indirect  effects  of  climate  change  such  as  loss  of  ecosystem  services  (e.g.  desertification,  water  shortage,  degradation  of  soil  quality  or  marine  ecology).

94,r221222a,physical  risks  emanating  from  adverse  climate-related  events  to  loss  of 
95,r221222a,"reputation  and  legal  risks.  Obviously,  the  strategies  for  mitigating  these "
96,r221222a,risks would have to be encompassed by sound public policy objectives and 
97,r221222a,all  stakeholders  would  need  to  play  their  role  in  helping  the  country 
98,r221222a,traverse and transform into a climate-resilient economy. 
99,r221222a,Challenges for Financial Intermediaries and Banks 
100,r221222a,"8.  Estimating the timing, frequency and severity of climate-related events is a "
101,r221222a,challenging  proposition  given  the  uncertainties  involved  in  the  process. 
102,r221222a,While  significant  progress  has  been  achieved  globally  on  developing 
103,r221222a,"scenarios and forward-looking approaches for modelling climate risks, the "
104,r221222a,requirement  of  past  data  and  the  unpredictable  nature  of  climate  change 
105,r221222a,makes estimation of climate events and their financial impact a challenging 
106,r221222a,"endeavour. Nonetheless, there is no alternative but to continue working on "
107,r221222a,this  path  of  self-discovery  and  slowly  gaining  momentum  as  we  cannot 
108,r221222a,afford to be inactive anymore.  
109,r221222a,9.  The  work  at  a  global  level  which  is  being  co-ordinated  by  the  Financial 
110,r221222a,"Stability  Board  (FSB)  and  endorsed  by  the  G-20,  rests  on  four  building "
111,r221222a,blocks needed for addressing Climate-Related Financial Risks. These four 
112,r221222a,"building  blocks,  viz.,  Disclosures,  Data,  Vulnerabilities  Analysis  and "
113,r221222a,Regulatory and Supervisory Practices and Tools which to my mind are pre-
114,r221222a,requisites  for  a  resilient  financial  system  when  augmented  by  informed 
115,r221222a,decision making. Let me discuss a bit further on these aspects. 
116,r221222a,10.  An  appropriate  and  adequate  disclosure  framework  must  have  three  key 
117,r221222a,"attributes  -  first,  it  should  have  inter-temporal  consistency,  second,  it "
118,r221222a,should be comparable and the third and most important is that it should be 
119,r221222a,"useful  for  decision  making.  Climate-related  disclosures  by  firms,  that "
120,r221222a,"largely contain these attributes, would help policymakers in understanding "
121,r221222a,the  enormity  of  the  task  ahead  in  terms  of  the  transition  funding 
122,r221222a,4 
123,r221222a,"    requirements.  Further,  this  would  help  banks  understand  the  level  of "
124,r221222a,carbon intensity in the business ventures in case they are to fund them so 
125,r221222a,that they are able to differentiate and appropriately price in such risks. 
126,r221222a,"11.  Internationally,  a  significant  body  of  work  has  been  done  on  disclosures. "
127,r221222a,The  FSB’s  Task  Force  on  Climate-related  Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD) 
128,r221222a,and  the  International  Sustainability  Standards  Board  (ISSB)  under  the 
129,r221222a,IFRS  Foundation  have  been  leading  this  work  along  with  other  standard 
130,r221222a,"setting bodies. In March 2022, the ISSB published Exposure Drafts on its "
131,r221222a,first  two  proposed  standards.  The  first  sets  out  general  sustainability-
132,r221222a,related  disclosure  requirements  while  the  other  specifies  climate-related 
133,r221222a,disclosure  requirements.  Given  the  global  nature  of  funding  markets  and 
134,r221222a,"cross-border  flows  of  capital,  the  idea  is  to  agree  upon  a  common  global "
135,r221222a,baseline disclosure requirement which is interoperable among jurisdictions 
136,r221222a,"for  comparability  and  consistency.  The  Reserve  Bank,  as  a  part  of "
137,r221222a,standard setting bodies has also been contributing and learning from global 
138,r221222a,discussions  and  experiences.  In  our  recently  published  Discussion  Paper 
139,r221222a,on  Climate  Risk  and  Sustainable  Finance  we  have  elaborated  on  how 
140,r221222a,climate-related disclosure is an important source of information for different 
141,r221222a,"stakeholders  (e.g.,  customers,  depositors,  investors,  and  regulators)  of "
142,r221222a,REs  to  understand  relevant  risks  faced  by  them  and  their  approach  to 
143,r221222a,addressing such issues.  
144,r221222a,"12.  For the corporates, beginning from the current financial year FY 2022-23, "
145,r221222a,SEBI  has  mandated  Business  Responsibility  and  Sustainability  Reporting 
146,r221222a,(BRSR)  for  the  top  1000  listed  companies  (by  market  capitalisation)  in 
147,r221222a,India. The disclosures under the BRSR framework would incentivize green 
148,r221222a,financing  and  help  banks  and  financial  institutions  in  estimating  their 
149,r221222a,climate-related exposure to these listed companies.  
150,r221222a,"13.  While  consistent  and  comparable  disclosures,  the  first  building  block, "
151,r221222a,"would  enable  financial  institutions  make  firm  level  risk  assessments,  the "
152,r221222a,"second  building  block,  data,  is  required  for  making  macro  level "
153,r221222a,5 
154,r221222a,"    assessment  of  risks.  Like  any  financial  risk,  reliable  and  comprehensive "
155,r221222a,data  on  climate  risk  related  exposures  would  aid  in  making  sound  policy 
156,r221222a,interventions and undertaking climate scenario analysis and stress testing 
157,r221222a,"for  the  assessment  of  risks  from  climate  events.  This  however  is,  easier "
158,r221222a,said  than  done.  While  global  efforts  are  underway  to  create  data 
159,r221222a,repositories  and  provide  guidance  on  collection  of  data  for  better 
160,r221222a,"comparability;  availability  of  high  quality,  granular  and  sufficient  data "
161,r221222a,remains  a  challenge  as  of  now.  Availability  of  granular  data  also  remains 
162,r221222a,crucial  for  modelling  the  forward-looking  nature  of  climate  events  and 
163,r221222a,developing metrics for monitoring climate-related financial risks. 
164,r221222a,"14.  The  third  building  block,  vulnerabilities  analysis,  is  again  a  macro  level "
165,r221222a,exercise  to  understand  the  financial  stability  risks  arising  out  of  climate 
166,r221222a,events and their impact on financial systems. It is focused on analysis and 
167,r221222a,stress  testing  using  various  scenarios  to  help  in  better  assessment  of 
168,r221222a,potential  pressure  points  in  the  financial  system  and  in  understanding 
169,r221222a,interlinkages  between 
170,r221222a,financial  sector  and  real  sector.  While 
171,r221222a,the 
172,r221222a,"development  of  climate  scenario  analysis,  stress  testing  scenarios  and "
173,r221222a,"analytical tools  are still  in  their infancy, the need for integrating them with "
174,r221222a,regular  monitoring  exercises  and  overall  financial  risk  assessment  has 
175,r221222a,been well recognised. One particular challenge in modelling climate-related 
176,r221222a,risks  is  the  long  time  horizon  which  has  to  be  considered.  The  climate 
177,r221222a,"events  may  often  span  across  decades,  if  not  centuries,  and  this  may "
178,r221222a,make  the  data  collection  exercise  quite  difficult  and  the  outcomes  more 
179,r221222a,uncertain. 
180,r221222a,15.  The fourth and final building block consists of initiatives which are being 
181,r221222a,undertaken  or  planned  by  the  regulators  and  supervisors  to  facilitate 
182,r221222a,"transition.  In  a  way,  this  is  a  culmination  of  the  work  taken  up  under  the "
183,r221222a,three  building  blocks  discussed  above.  The  regulators  may  need  to  fine 
184,r221222a,tune  the  existing  prudential  policies  to  integrate  the  climate  risks  into  the 
185,r221222a,"regulatory frameworks.  At  the same time, from a supervisory perspective, "
186,r221222a,6 
187,r221222a,    the  expectations  may  have  to  be  set  and  communicated  to  all  regulated 
188,r221222a,"entities  regarding  climate-related  risks,  encompassing  organisational "
189,r221222a,"strategy,  governance,  risk  management  and  assurance  functions.  The "
190,r221222a,global  efforts  undertaken  so  far  seem  to  suggest  that  integrating  climate-
191,r221222a,related  risks  and  capturing  them  by  fine  tuning  existing  prudential 
192,r221222a,frameworks may be possible.  
193,r221222a,16.  The  Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision  (BCBS)  has  published 
194,r221222a,Principles for the Effective Management and Supervision of Climate-related 
195,r221222a,"Financial  Risks  in  June  2022.  In  October  2022,  the  Financial  Stability "
196,r221222a,Board  (FSB)  published  its  Final  Report  on  Supervisory  and  Regulatory 
197,r221222a,"Approaches  to  Climate-related  Risks.  Earlier  in  March  2022,  the  NGFS "
198,r221222a,published  a 
199,r221222a,"‘Statement  on  Nature-related  Financial  Risks’,  which "
200,r221222a,"acknowledges  that  failure  to  account  for,  mitigate,  and  adapt  to  nature-"
201,r221222a,related  risks  could  have  significant  macroeconomic  implications  and 
202,r221222a,become a source of financial stability risk. While guidance has been made 
203,r221222a,"available,  regulated  entities  may  need  time,  resources,  and  capacity  to "
204,r221222a,integrate  climate-related  considerations 
205,r221222a,into 
206,r221222a,their  decision-making 
207,r221222a,frameworks and customer facing business lines.  
208,r221222a,Private Sector Initiatives  
209,r221222a,"17.  In  the  private  sector,  decarbonization  and  digitalization  are  emerging  as "
210,r221222a,megatrends  that  could  compel  sectors  and  corporates  to  undertake 
211,r221222a,structural  changes  and  fundamentally  alter  their  traditional  business 
212,r221222a,models. It is heartening to note that some of the leading Indian companies 
213,r221222a,"in  the  hard  to  abate  sectors  like  steel  and  cement9,  for  example,  are "
214,r221222a,working  on  an  ambitious  decarbonization  agenda  aimed  at  reducing  the 
215,r221222a,carbon footprint in their production process.  
216,r221222a,"9  The  steel  and  cement  sectors  are  energy  and  emission  intensive.  They  are  also  hard-to-abate,  meaning  that  decarbonization of these sectors requires deep systemic changes in the way these materials are produced, used,  and recycled. "
217,r221222a,7 
218,r221222a,                                                                 18.  Banks  and  financial  institutions  may  have  to  to  step  up  their  engagement

229,r221222a,"growing  segment  globally  in  the  sustainable  finance  market10. India  too, "
230,r221222a,has  seen  the  introduction  of  sustainable  finance  instruments  such  as 
231,r221222a,sustainability-linked  loans.  Liberalised  External  Commercial  Borrowings 
232,r221222a,(ECB) norms have also enabled Indian companies to raise offshore finance 
233,r221222a,"through green bonds,  social  bonds, sustainable bonds, and sustainability-"
234,r221222a,"linked  bonds.  In  line  with  global  trends,  the  issuance  of  sustainable  debt "
235,r221222a,has  risen  sharply  in  India  during  Calendar  Year  2021  taking  it  to  the  2nd 
236,r221222a,place among emerging economies in cumulative Green Bond Issuances11. 
237,r221222a,Mechanisms such as blended finance12 and risk-sharing facilities are also 
238,r221222a,being utilised to finance climate and sustainability-related projects. 
239,r221222a,20.  The above initiatives from the financial sector in India and across the globe 
240,r221222a,make  one  believe  that  the  private  sector  is  very  much  alive  to  the 
241,r221222a,challenges ahead of us.

250,r221222a,"transition  finance  for  businesses  and  sectors  that  are  not  so  green,  to "
251,r221222a,"adopt  cleaner  technologies,  increase  energy  efficiency  and  become "
252,r221222a,greener over time. Green finance can play a crucial role in making India’s 
253,r221222a,economy resilient to climate change impacts. During the COP26 Summit in 
254,r221222a,"November  2021,  the  Hon’ble  Prime  Minister  had  announced  that  by  the "
255,r221222a,"year 2070, India will achieve the target of net-zero. This would necessitate "
256,r221222a,creating  an  enabling  ecosystem  for  financing  India’s  transition  to  a  green 
257,r221222a,economy. 
258,r221222a,"22.  In  India,  both  the  Government  and  Reserve  Bank  of  India  have  been "
259,r221222a,participating  in  the  global  discussions  on  climate  risks  and  have  already 
260,r221222a,"taken quite a few initiatives in this regard. The Government, in the Union "
261,r221222a,Budget for 2022-23 announced that climate action would be a key priority 
262,r221222a,"and  proposed  that  as  a  part  of  its  overall  market  borrowings  in  2022-23, "
263,r221222a,Sovereign Green Bonds (SGBs) will be issued for mobilizing resources for 
264,r221222a,green  infrastructure.  The  proceeds  will  be  deployed  in  public  sector 
265,r221222a,projects  which  will  help  in  reducing  the  carbon  intensity  of  the  economy. 
266,r221222a,"This  is  by  no  means  a  small  step.  Over  time,  the  SGBs  would  provide  a "
267,r221222a,pricing  reference  for  the  private  sector  entities  in  India  for  their  INR 
268,r221222a,"denominated borrowing for ESG linked debt. Thus, the issuance of SGBs "
269,r221222a,would help in creating an ecosystem which fosters a greater flow of capital 
270,r221222a,into green projects and entities undertaking such projects. 
271,r221222a,"23.  Recognising the need for concerted efforts in the area, the Reserve Bank "
272,r221222a,has  concomitantly  set  up  a  Sustainable  Finance  Group  (SFG)  within  its 
273,r221222a,Department of Regulation in May 2021 to lead the regulatory initiatives in 
274,r221222a,area  of  climate  risk  and  sustainable  finance  in  the  Indian  context.    As  I 
275,r221222a,"mentioned  previously,  RBI  had  already  released  a  Discussion  Paper  on "
276,r221222a,Climate  Risk  and  Sustainable  Finance  in  July  2022  covering  a  gamut  of 
277,r221222a,issues on the RBI’s website for comments of stakeholders. It is heartening 
278,r221222a,to  mention  that  we  have  received  comments  from  a  large  number  of 
279,r221222a,9 
280,r221222a,    regulated  entities  and  other  stakeholders.  These  are  being  carefully 
281,r221222a,examined  before  we  frame  any  regulatory  guidance  on  climate  risk  and 
282,r221222a,sustainable finance.  
283,r221222a,"24.    Along  with  the  Discussion  Paper,  we  had  also  released  the  results  of  a "
284,r221222a,"survey  undertaken  to  assess  the  approach,  level  of  preparedness  and "
285,r221222a,progress  made  by  leading  scheduled  commercial  banks  in  India  for 
286,r221222a,"managing  climate-related  financial  risk.  The  survey,  which  covered  12 "
287,r221222a,"public sector banks, 16 private sector banks and 6 foreign banks, provided "
288,r221222a,useful insights and the feedback from this exercise will help in shaping our 
289,r221222a,regulatory and supervisory approach.  
290,r221222a,25.  Another notable feature for our financial ecosystem is that while rest of the 
291,r221222a,world is still grappling in developing new instruments to funnel funding to 
292,r221222a,"green  and  sustainable  companies  and  projects,  we  already  have  a  well-"
293,r221222a,accepted incentive-based instrument in the form of Priority Sector Lending 
294,r221222a,"(PSL)  norms  to  encourage  lending  to  such  projects.  Over  the  years,  we "
295,r221222a,have been taking various policy measures to promote and support green 
296,r221222a,"finance  initiatives  through  this  route.  For  example,  renewable  energy "
297,r221222a,projects have been included as a part of Priority Sector Lending (PSL). In 
298,r221222a,"2012,  Reserve  Bank  included  loans  sanctioned  by  banks  directly  to "
299,r221222a,individuals for setting up off-grid solar and other off-grid renewable energy 
300,r221222a,"solutions  for  households  and  in  2015,  the  PSL  criteria  was  expanded  to "
301,r221222a,bank loans up to a limit of ₹15 crore to borrowers for purposes like solar / 
302,r221222a,"bio-mass  based  power  generators,  windmills,  micro-hydel  plants  and  for "
303,r221222a,"non-conventional energy based public utilities, viz., street lighting systems, "
304,r221222a,"and  remote  village  electrification.  In  2020,  this  limit  for  bank  loans  was "
305,r221222a,"doubled to ₹30 crore. It is heartening to note that in recent years, leading "
306,r221222a,banks  in  India  have  also  begun  stepping  up  their  exposure  to  the 
307,r221222a,renewable energy sector.  
308,r221222a,10 
309,r221222a,      Enablers for Scaling up Green Finance in India 
310,r221222a,26. Banks and financial institutions have always been the backbone of India's 
311,r221222a,"economic growth and as the country pivots to sustainable growth, they will "
312,r221222a,have  to  take  a  lead  and  accelerate  green  lending.  To  support  this 
313,r221222a,"acceleration,  a  number  of  structural  changes  may  be  needed  in  the "
314,r221222a,"traditional  lending  approach,  including  evaluation  and  certification  of  the "
315,r221222a,green credentials of projects. In order to give focused attention to scaling 
316,r221222a,"up green finance,  banks and financial institutions would have to invest in "
317,r221222a,human  resources  and  capacity  building  efforts  as  well  as  integrate 
318,r221222a,environmental  and  social  risk  considerations  into  their  corporate  credit 
319,r221222a,appraisal mechanisms.  
320,r221222a,27.  A formal definition of green finance along with a taxonomy13 is the need of 
321,r221222a,hour  as  it  would  enable  more  precise  tracking  of  finance  flows  to  green 
322,r221222a,"sectors  in  India,  which  in  turn,  would  help  design  effective  policy, "
323,r221222a,regulations and institutional mechanisms directed towards increasing both 
324,r221222a,public  and  private  investments.  A  taxonomy  would  also  help  banks  and 
325,r221222a,financial  institutions  in  better  assessing  the  climate  risk  in  their  loan 
326,r221222a,"portfolio, scaling up green and sustainable finance and mitigating the risk "
327,r221222a,of greenwashing. 
328,r221222a,28.    Another  key  challenge  in  scaling  up  green  finance  is  the  availability  of  a 
329,r221222a,robust  ecosystem  for  third  party  verification  /  assurance  and  impact 
330,r221222a,assessment  and  the  green  credentials  of  businesses  and  projects.  This 
331,r221222a,would  also  address  potential  greenwashing  concerns  and  ensure 
332,r221222a,unhindered flow of capital and funding to the entities.   
333,r221222a,"13 A taxonomy is a classification system, establishing a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities. It  plays an important role in helping an economy scale up sustainable investment and provides all stakeholders with  appropriate definitions for the economic activities which can be considered environmentally sustainable.  "
334,r221222a,11 
335,r221222a,                                                                   29.  The challenge regarding the availability of data and disclosures would also 
336,r221222a,"need  to  be  addressed  quickly.  In  this  context,  the  disclosure  standards "
337,r221222a,prescribed by SEBI for top 1000 listed entities by market capitalisation is a 
338,r221222a,welcome step. I am confident that the listed entities would not only adhere 
339,r221222a,to  the  mandatory  disclosures  but  would  also  not  hesitate  to  follow  those 
340,r221222a,which are additional and voluntary in nature.  
341,r221222a,30.    Green  finance  must  be  scaled  up  rapidly  to  meet  India’s  climate  targets 
342,r221222a,under  the  updated  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  communicated  to 
343,r221222a,the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
344,r221222a,in  August  2022.  The  enhanced  ambition  requires  mobilization  of  green 
345,r221222a,"finance  at  a  much  faster  pace.  For  example,  green  infrastructure "
346,r221222a,investment  trusts  could  help  scale  up  green  finance  as  also  deepen  the 
347,r221222a,"local bond market. But in the end, all these ideas need a clear intent from "
348,r221222a,all stakeholders in order for it to be implemented and sustained. 
349,r221222a,Concluding Remarks 
350,r221222a,"31.  To sum up, climate change may result in physical and transition risks that "
351,r221222a,could have implications for the physical safety and financial soundness of 
352,r221222a,individual regulated entities as well as for the stability of financial system. 
353,r221222a,"Thus,  there  is  a  need  for  regulated  entities  to  develop  and  implement "
354,r221222a,comprehensive frameworks for understanding and assessing the potential 
355,r221222a,impact  of  climate-related  financial  risks  in  their  business  strategy  and 
356,r221222a,operations.  
357,r221222a,32.  We  need  to  be  conscious  that  climate  risk  is  the  biggest  challenge 
358,r221222a,confronting  us  and  addressing  it  decisively  is  our  joint  responsibility. 
359,r221222a,Financial  sector  has  a  key  role  to  play  as  it  is  the  sector  which  finances 
360,r221222a,businesses and can influence their activities. Banks would have their role 
361,r221222a,cut  out  in  handholding  the  businesses  and  arranging  for  the  transition 
362,r221222a,finance  required  by  the  firms  as  they  try  to  shift  their  strategies  to  make 
363,r221222a,them more  sustainable  and  planet  friendly.  The central  banks can  play  a 
364,r221222a,12 
365,r221222a,    significant  role  in  shaping  the  response  of  financial  sector  to  the 
366,r221222a,challenges  posed  by  risks  emerging  from  the  climate  change  through 
367,r221222a,appropriate guidance and regulations. 
368,r221222a,33.  The Indian economy is at a stage where we need to grow rapidly but the 
369,r221222a,challenge  before  us  is  to  think  of  ways  to  incorporate  climate  risk  and 
370,r221222a,ESG-related  considerations  into  commercial  lending  and  investment 
371,r221222a,"decisions  while  simultaneously  balancing  the  needs  of  credit  expansion, "
372,r221222a,"economic  growth,  and  social  development.  Collective engagement  would "
373,r221222a,help  build  on  our  early  progress  and  go  a  long  way  in  addressing  the 
374,r221222a,challenges of climate change. 
375,r221222a,Let  me  conclude  now  and  leave  you  with  these  points  to  ponder  as  you 
376,r221222a,continue with your deliberations during the course of the ensuing discussions 
377,r221222a,at this event. 
378,r221222a,Thank you for inviting me to share my thoughts at this summit and thanks for a 
379,r221222a,patient hearing.
