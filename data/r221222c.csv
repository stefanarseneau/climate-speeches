6,r221222c,            Introduction 
7,r221222c,"Economies  around  the  world  have  been  facing  elevated  inflation,  and  attention  has  been "
8,r221222c,drawn to the responses made by governments and central banks (Chart 1). It is difficult to 
9,r221222c,predict how long the current inflation will last in the medium to long run. One recent narrative 
10,r221222c,"regarding  inflation  is  that,  since  the  mild-inflation  regime  accompanied  by  anxiety  over "
11,r221222c,"deflation  has  ended,  we  are  about  to  enter  a  regime  of  high  inflation.1  There  are  others, "
12,r221222c,"however, who are skeptical whether inflation will take hold (Wolf 2022a; Krugman 2022a, "
13,r221222c,2022b). 
14,r221222c,"Since  the  2000s,  the  global  economy  has  been  concerned  about  secular  stagnation  or "
15,r221222c,"""Japanification""  --  the  combination  of  low  inflation  (or  deflation),  low  growth,  and  low "
16,r221222c,interest rates. But will this era of Japanification be finally over as the narrative insists? In 
17,r221222c,"addition, as inflation has started to be observed worldwide, the efficacy or validity of the idea  of a high-pressure economy has become a controversial topic.2  On the question of how long  the current inflation will last, I would like to discuss future monetary policy and the high-"
18,r221222c,"pressure  economy  from  a  medium-  to  long-term  perspective,  rather  than  examining  the "
19,r221222c,current inflation. 
20,r221222c,John Hicks argued that the dynamics of money and the history of monetary economics are 
21,r221222c,"closely  related  to each  other.  He  said  monetary  theory  ""belongs  to  monetary  history""  in  a "
22,r221222c,"sense, because ""a large part of the best work on Money is topical"" and ""throughout the whole "
23,r221222c,"time -- back before Ricardo, forward after Keynes -- money itself has been evolving"" (Hicks "
24,r221222c,"1967a, pp. 156-57). In order to consider the future of monetary policy, I will first outline the "
25,r221222c,"recent inflation narrative and then look back at the history of monetary economics, including "
26,r221222c,economic history and the history of economics. The history of monetary economics reveals 
27,r221222c,the  importance  of  nominal  values  in  the  economy  and  the  role  of  monetary  policy  in 
28,r221222c,"determining them. The classical monetary economists, on whom I will mainly focus today, "
29,r221222c,"already recognized the non-neutrality of money -- that is, the fact that the nominal value of "
30,r221222c,"1  See The Economist (2022a, 2022b), Spence (2022), and Rogoff (2022a, 2022b). For this narrative  by  members  of  the Japan Association  of  Business Cycle  studies  (JABC),  see Shimazu  (2022)  and  Kataoka (2022).  2  The idea of a high-pressure economy has its origins in Okun (1973). For studies conducted by the  Bank of Japan, see Kaihatsu et al. (2018) and the Bank of Japan Research and Statistics Department  (2018). For an assessment of a high-pressure economy in the United States, see FataÃÅs (2021). "
31,r221222c,1 
32,r221222c,"                                                            money affects the real value of the economy. In light of this historical context, I will go on to "
33,r221222c,"consider future monetary policy, drawing the conclusion that the mild-inflation regime is still "
34,r221222c,"in place and concern over Japanification has not yet been dispelled, particularly in Japan. "
35,r221222c,I. Looking at the Present: Is the Mild-Inflation Regime Over? 
36,r221222c,Has  the  mild-inflation  regime ended  because  of  the  onset  of  the  current  global  inflation?3 
37,r221222c,The narrative that we are about to enter a high-inflation regime is based on the following six 
38,r221222c,factors (Chart 2). 
39,r221222c,First is the growing role of government. Some argue that inflationary pressure on the economy 
40,r221222c,"will increase due to higher government spending, tighter regulations, and accumulating fiscal "
41,r221222c,deficit and government debt. 
42,r221222c,The second factor is the convergence of economic growth. With China's high growth coming 
43,r221222c,"to an end, the growth rates in emerging economies are declining. This suggests that the growth "
44,r221222c,rates of advanced economies and those of emerging economies are beginning to converge. 
45,r221222c,"The third factor is the end of globalization, or deglobalization. Sluggish growth in goods trade "
46,r221222c,"since  2008,  coupled  with  recent  geopolitical  tensions  and  rising  concern  over  economic "
47,r221222c,"security, has led to a global restructuring of supply chains. It has been argued that the shift "
48,r221222c,from the era of integration and efficiency to that of segregation and stability will bring high 
49,r221222c,inflation. 
50,r221222c,"The fourth factor is the change in demographics. According to Goodhart and Pradhan (2020), "
51,r221222c,the global low inflation environment is the result of a significant increase in the world's labor 
52,r221222c,supply  from  1990  to  2018  due  to the  rise  of  China  and  developments  in  demographics  in 
53,r221222c,"advanced economies. However, they point out that this trend is now reversing: a declining "
54,r221222c,and aging population in China and advanced economies will lead to a return of inflation. 
55,r221222c,"3  The distinction between a mild-inflation regime and a high-inflation regime is not  clear-cut. One  may argue, however, that the former is a state of inflation staying at around the 2 percent inflation  targets of major central banks, whereas the latter is a state of inflation being more than double 2 percent  but less than 10 percent. "
56,r221222c,2 
57,r221222c,                                                                    The fifth factor is the transition to a decarbonized society to address climate change. Some 
58,r221222c,have argued that this transition will lead to so-called greenflation. 
59,r221222c,The sixth factor is the onset of a wartime economy. There is a view that growing geopolitical 
60,r221222c,"risks  could  lead  to  a  wartime  economy,  including  a  return  to  the  kind  of  inflationary "
61,r221222c,environment that was seen during the Cold War (Pozsar 2022). 
62,r221222c,"I would like to look at these factors one by one. First, the role of government has been steadily "
63,r221222c,"growing in size and scope.4  Since the 1980s, there have been periods when attempts were "
64,r221222c,"made to curb such growth, but the uptrend continues. Analyzing the effects of government "
65,r221222c,"regulation is not straightforward since the nature of such regulations may matter, but it is safe "
66,r221222c,to say at least that they have tended to proliferate. Inflation has trended downward during this 
67,r221222c,"same period. Also, we can find no clear relationship between inflation rates and the ratio to "
68,r221222c,GDP of government spending or government debt (Charts 3 and 4). 
69,r221222c,"With  regard  to  the  second  factor,  it  is  unclear  whether  the  slowdown  in  growth  rates  is "
70,r221222c,"inflationary or deflationary in nature. Indeed, low growth is precisely the phenomenon over "
71,r221222c,"which concern was raised amid secular stagnation, with some arguing that low growth is the "
72,r221222c,cause of low inflation. 
73,r221222c,"As for the third factor, the argument over whether globalization has brought low inflation is "
74,r221222c,empirically  inconclusive  (Kuroda  2018).  Some  hold  that  it  is  too  early  to  tell  whether 
75,r221222c,globalization  has  even  run  its  course. Although  growth  in  goods  trade  has  decelerated  in 
76,r221222c,"recent  years,  trade  in  services  continues  to  grow  at  a  high  rate  (Chart  5).  Naturally,  the "
77,r221222c,restructuring of supply chains from the perspective of economic security can serve as a cost-
78,r221222c,"push factor, as firms opt for the security of procurement over minimizing costs. On the other "
79,r221222c,"hand, given that services industries are labor intensive, if automation of the services sector "
80,r221222c,moves ahead globally -- through the use of means such as artificial intelligence (AI) -- and 
81,r221222c,"wages converge on a global level, this may turn out to have a disinflationary effect (Baldwin "
82,r221222c,"4  The Economist (2021) shows that the ratio of government spending to GDP in advanced economies  has  trended  upward  since  1870.  Adolf  Wagner's  law  of  increasing  state  activity  and  Peacock  and  Wiseman's displacement effect hypothesis argue that government spending will inevitably increase.  See also, Robinson (2020). "
83,r221222c,3 
84,r221222c,                                                                2022; Wolf 2022b). 
85,r221222c,"Fourth, the impact of demographics is uncertain. It is true that the decline in labor supply due "
86,r221222c,"to a declining and aging population could become inflationary. On the other hand, longer life "
87,r221222c,expectancies can motivate people to build up their precautionary savings and push up savings 
88,r221222c,rates. Declining birthrates will cause reductions not only in the labor force population but 
89,r221222c,"also in the consumer population, which, among other factors, could have an adverse impact "
90,r221222c,"on the growth rate. This has more often been regarded as a deflationary factor, particularly in "
91,r221222c,Japan. 
92,r221222c,"As for the fifth factor, greenflation, the impact of decarbonization on economic and financial "
93,r221222c,"conditions  is  complicated.  If  it  is  thought  of  as  a  response  to  negative  externalities,  this "
94,r221222c,"implies firms taking on costs that they have previously not faced, which becomes a cost-push "
95,r221222c,factor. What is not clear is whether this will elevate inflation or have a disinflationary effect 
96,r221222c,"by suppressing aggregate demand. Conversely, if investment related to decarbonization rises, "
97,r221222c,"this could stimulate aggregate demand and feed into demand-pull inflation. In this respect, "
98,r221222c,whether  greenflation  occurs  will  depend  not  so  much  on  cost-push  factors  but  on 
99,r221222c,developments in aggregate demand (Schnabel 2022). 
100,r221222c,"The last factor, the onset of a wartime economy, is potentially the most inflationary one. One "
101,r221222c,study finds that the last 12 largest wars resulted in a sharp rise in inflation and nominal interest 
102,r221222c,"rates  during  and  in  the  aftermath  of  war. The  study  shows  that,  especially  in  wars  fought "
103,r221222c,"globally, inflation peaked at 8 percent on average one year after the war ended and took about "
104,r221222c,three years to subside (Chankova and Daly 2021). 
105,r221222c,"Next, I would like to address, more generally, things to keep in mind regarding the impact of "
106,r221222c,"these factors on price developments. First, many of the inflation factors listed here are cost-"
107,r221222c,"push factors. However, it is well known that cost-push inflation does not last long. When an "
108,r221222c,"exogenous shock occurs, adjustment from old to new pricing mechanisms takes place. After "
109,r221222c,"adjustment, the rising inflation rate is likely to return to the steady-state inflation rate; so, the "
110,r221222c,"important point is how this rate is affected. Of course, it is possible that cost-push factors will "
111,r221222c,"remain, but whether they will push up the steady-state inflation rate is uncertain. "
112,r221222c,4 
113,r221222c,"            Second,  related  to  the  fact  that  cost-push  inflation  is  unsustainable,  the  factors  being "
114,r221222c,"addressed here are real factors, and it is not obvious what their impact on prices would be. If "
115,r221222c,"we  think  of  prices  as  the  price  of  goods  and  services  relative  to  money,  it  would  seem "
116,r221222c,necessary to take monetary factors into consideration. 
117,r221222c,"Third,  when  considering  these  issues  within  the  framework  of  monetary  policy,  it  is "
118,r221222c,appropriate to consider the relationship between the natural rate of interest and market interest 
119,r221222c,"rates. To deem a real factor to be inflationary, we have to observe a tendency for the natural "
120,r221222c,"rate of interest to rise vis-aÃÄ-vis market interest rates. In fact, however, the aforementioned real "
121,r221222c,"factors affect the natural rate of interest through various channels, and the rate can either rise "
122,r221222c,or fall (Chart 6).5 
123,r221222c,"To give an example from demographics, because post-retirement households tend to draw "
124,r221222c,"down  their  savings,  capital  supply  may  decrease.  This  would  push  up  the  natural  rate  of "
125,r221222c,"interest.  On  the  other  hand,  households  anticipating  longer  life  expectancies  will  seek  to "
126,r221222c,"augment their savings accordingly, which may increase capital supply. This would lower the "
127,r221222c,"natural  rate  of  interest.  Moreover,  if  the  declining  population  reduces  the  labor  force "
128,r221222c,"population, the per-capita capital equipment ratio will rise, leading to a fall in capital demand. "
129,r221222c,This would also lower the natural rate of interest. We thus ought to say that the overall impact 
130,r221222c,"of  demographics  on  the  natural  rate  of  interest  is  uncertain.  Furthermore,  if  uncertainties "
131,r221222c,"increase  on the  whole,  this  could  motivate  people  to  build  up  their  precautionary  savings, "
132,r221222c,which in turn would boost capital supply. This would consequently lower the natural rate of 
133,r221222c,interest. 
134,r221222c,II. Looking Back: History of Monetary Economics 
135,r221222c,"So  far,  I  have  not  discussed  the  role  of  monetary  policy.  Even  though  the  natural  rate  of "
136,r221222c,"interest fluctuates, market interest rates are not necessarily determined accordingly. Let me "
137,r221222c,lay out the framework for my analysis. The current analytical framework has been developed 
138,r221222c,"5  Gopinath  (2022)  considers  the  following  seven  channels  through  which  the  novel  coronavirus  (COVID-19)  pandemic  will  have  enduring  effects  on  the  natural  rate  of  interest:  inequality,  demographics,  labor  supply,  productivity,  savings  and  safe  assets  demand,  debt  in  advanced  economies, and climate transition. She states that only the last two channels can clearly push up the  natural rate of interest. "
139,r221222c,5 
140,r221222c,"                                                              throughout the history of monetary economics, but many issues remain unresolved. I want to "
141,r221222c,"center my discussion around classical figures in the history of monetary economics, mainly "
142,r221222c,"David Hume and Henry Thornton (Chart 7). Following Fisher (1911), the quantity theory of "
143,r221222c,"money broadly recognizes the non-neutrality of money in the short run, but holds that money "
144,r221222c,"is neutral in the long run. Nonetheless, there have been some economists who have in fact "
145,r221222c,argued for the long-run non-neutrality of money (Humphrey 1991). 
146,r221222c,A. The Price Revolution and Hume 
147,r221222c,Precious metals discovered in South America in the 15th century flowed into Europe in large 
148,r221222c,"quantities. From then until the middle of the 17th century, the inflation rate in Europe rose to "
149,r221222c,around 1.0-1.5 percent. This is known as the price revolution. The quantity theory of money 
150,r221222c,"grew out of this experience. Let me turn to Hume here. In Of Money (1752), he acknowledges "
151,r221222c,"the impact of the price revolution on the real economy, stating that "
152,r221222c,"the greater quantity of money, like the Roman characters, is rather inconvenient, and "
153,r221222c,requires  greater  trouble  both  to  keep  and  transport  it.  But  notwithstanding  this 
154,r221222c,"conclusion, which must be allowed just, it is certain, that, since the discovery of the "
155,r221222c,"mines in America, industry has [i]ncreased in all the nations of Europe, except in the "
156,r221222c,"possessors of those mines; and this may justly be ascribed, amongst other reasons, to "
157,r221222c,"the [i]ncrease  of  gold  and  silver. Accordingly  we  find,  that,  in  every  kingdom,  into "
158,r221222c,"which money begins to flow in greater abundance than formerly, every thing takes a "
159,r221222c,"new face: labour and industry gain life; the merchant becomes more enterprising, the "
160,r221222c,"manufacturer more diligent and skilful, and even the farmer follows his plough with "
161,r221222c,"greater alacrity and attention. (Hume 1987, pp. 285-86) "
162,r221222c,"""Industry"" here should be interpreted as including not only the quantity of labor supply but "
163,r221222c,"also its quality. However, Hume (1987, p. 286) adds the following qualification: ""It is only in "
164,r221222c,"[an] interval or intermediate situation, between the acquisition of money and rise of prices, "
165,r221222c,"that the [i]ncreasing quantity of gold and silver is favourable to industry."" The reason for this "
166,r221222c,"is the rigidity of money wage contracts. Predicated on this, we would assume that a rise in "
167,r221222c,"prices only temporarily reduces real wages, and the quantity of labor supply would simply "
168,r221222c,"increase. Hume (1987, p. 288) concludes that ""it is of no manner of consequence, with regard "
169,r221222c,6 
170,r221222c,"          to the domestic happiness of a state, whether money be in a greater or less quantity."" However, "
171,r221222c,he immediately adds that 
172,r221222c,"the  good  policy  of  the  magistrate  consists  only  in  keeping  it,  if  possible,  still "
173,r221222c,"[i]ncreasing; because, by that means, he keeps alive a spirit of industry in the nation, "
174,r221222c,"and [i]ncreases the stock of labour, in which consists all real power and riches. A nation, "
175,r221222c,"whose  money  decreases,  is  actually,  at  that  time,  weaker  and  more  miserable  than "
176,r221222c,"another nation, which possesses no more money, but is on the [i]ncreasing hand. This "
177,r221222c,"will be easily accounted for, if we consider, that the alterations in the quantity of money, "
178,r221222c,"either  on  one  side  or  the  other,  are  not  immediately  attended  with  proportionable "
179,r221222c,"alterations in the price of commodities. (Hume 1987, p. 288) "
180,r221222c,"What Hume is pointing out here is, first, that money has no effect on the real economy in the "
181,r221222c,"long run and ends up only determining prices. Even if money has an impact, it is only in an "
182,r221222c,interval or intermediate situation; this is the argument for the long-run neutrality of money. 
183,r221222c,"Second, however, what he is setting out as a policy argument can also be taken to suggest the "
184,r221222c,"non-neutrality  of  money.  Furthermore,  he  is  drawing  attention  to  the  harmful  effects  of "
185,r221222c,deflation in contrast to the benefits of inflation. 
186,r221222c,Many interpretations have been put forward as to how these two propositions can coexist.6 
187,r221222c,"The compatibility of the two propositions aside, in the latter we may be able to locate the "
188,r221222c,"roots of the idea of a high-pressure economy. The key point is that Hume, who advocated the "
189,r221222c,"quantity theory of money, also recognized the complex relationship between nominal and real "
190,r221222c,"values, while distinguishing between what is now called the short and long term. Hume is "
191,r221222c,"one  of  the  economists  who  identified  sustainable  economic  growth,  looking  to  people's "
192,r221222c,"industrial activities, knowledge, and systems as the driving force behind economic growth. "
193,r221222c,What is crucial is how the real and monetary factors of this economic growth are related.7 
194,r221222c,Recent  research  has  shown  that  the  price  revolution  also  had  a  real  impact.  When  the 
195,r221222c,"production of precious metals increased, so did nominal GDP; and, while real GDP increased, "
196,r221222c,"6  For an overview and interpretations of related research, see Sakamoto (2011, pp. 199-251), Dimand  (2013), and Schabas and Wennerlind (2020, pp. 159-60).  7  See Brewer (2010), and Schabas and Wennerlind (2020). "
197,r221222c,7 
198,r221222c,                                                              prices  did  not  rise  to  the  same  extent  at  the  same  time.8  Former  chairman  of  the  Federal 
199,r221222c,Reserve  Board  Alan  Greenspan  also  argued  that  deflation  is  a  threat  because  it  stifles 
200,r221222c,corporate vitality.9  Hume's argument overlaps in part with this view. 
201,r221222c,B. The Bank Restriction Period and Thornton 
202,r221222c,Hume  was  skeptical  of  the  role  of  banks  and  paper  credit.10   Hume's  friend Adam  Smith 
203,r221222c,"pointed out the benefits of banks (Laidler 1981). However, an analysis of paper credit had to "
204,r221222c,"wait until the next generation, and this was the accomplishment of Thornton. "
205,r221222c,"In 1797, against the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars, the Bank of England (BOE) suspended "
206,r221222c,the convertibility of its notes into gold. This was initially intended as a temporary measure 
207,r221222c,but lasted until 1821. The years from 1797 to 1821 are known as the Bank Restriction Period. 
208,r221222c,Inflation  continued  in  the  United  Kingdom  following  the  suspension  of  gold  conversion. 
209,r221222c,Controversy erupted over when conversion should be resumed.11  Thornton took an active 
210,r221222c,"part  in  this  controversy,  primarily  through  publication  of  An  Enquiry  Into  the  Nature  and "
211,r221222c,Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain (1802). His accomplishments can be summed up 
212,r221222c,"in  three  points.12   First,  in  an  era  in  which  credit  played  a  significant  role  in  finance,  he "
213,r221222c,"analyzed why rapid financial swings lead to economic swings. Second, he pioneered a theory "
214,r221222c,based on the distinction between what we now call the natural rate of interest and market 
215,r221222c,"interest  rates. Third,  he  paved  the  way  for  the  monetary  and  prudential  policies of  central "
216,r221222c,banks in terms of setting market interest rates and providing liquidity. 
217,r221222c,"With respect to the first point, Thornton deemed that the reason rapid financial swings lead "
218,r221222c,"to economic swings lies in the nature of money. During an economic downturn, manufacturers "
219,r221222c,"8  According to Palma (2022, pp. 1608-9), ""a 10 percent increase in precious metals production relative  to their stock at time t leads to an increase in real GDP of approximately 0.9 percent by year t + 9.  After this peak, the (point estimate) effect of the monetary shock on real GDP diminishes, as the price  level rise increases in intensity.""  9  Watanabe (2022, pp. 285-87) touches upon Greenspan's view on deflation.  10  Hume (1987, p. 284) stated: ""To endeavour artificially to [i]ncrease [paper] credit, can never be the  interest of any trading nation.""  11  For the so-called Bullionist controversy, see Laidler (2000).  12  For Thornton's prominent accomplishments, see Hicks (1967b), Laidler (1987), Murphy (2009, pp.  189-214), Arnon (2011, pp. 96-125), and Wakatabe (2013, pp. 102-11). "
220,r221222c,8 
221,r221222c,"                                                              and merchants attempt to sell off their goods in pursuit of money. At the same time, broad-"
222,r221222c,"based buying restraint emerges.13  As a result, ""the manufacturer, on account of the unusual "
223,r221222c,"scarcity of money, may even, though the selling price of his article should be profitable, be "
224,r221222c,"absolutely compelled by necessity to slacken, if not suspend, his operations"" (Thornton 1978, "
225,r221222c,p. 118). The resulting fall in prices affects employment. 
226,r221222c,That very diminution in the price of manufactures which is supposed to cause them to 
227,r221222c,"be exported, may also, if carried very far, produce a suspension of the labour of those "
228,r221222c,who fabricate them. The masters naturally turn off their hands when they find their 
229,r221222c,"article  selling  exceedingly  ill.  It  is true,  that if  we  could  suppose the  diminution  of "
230,r221222c,"bank paper to produce permanently a diminution in the value of all articles whatsoever, "
231,r221222c,"and  a  diminution  .  .  .  in  the  rate  of  wages  also,  the  encouragement  to  future "
232,r221222c,"manufactures would be the same, though there would be a loss on the stock in hand. "
233,r221222c,"The  tendency,  however,  of  a  very  great  and  sudden  reduction  of  the  accustomed "
234,r221222c,"number of bank notes, is to create an unusual and temporary distress, and a fall of "
235,r221222c,"price  arising  from  that  distress.  But  a  fall  arising  from  temporary  distress,  will  be "
236,r221222c,"attended probably with no correspondent fall in the rate of wages; for the fall of price, "
237,r221222c,"and the distress, will be understood to be temporary, and the rate of wages, we know, "
238,r221222c,"is  not  so  variable  as  the  price  of  goods. There  is  reason,  therefore,  to  fear  that  the "
239,r221222c,unnatural and extraordinary low price arising from the sort of distress of which we 
240,r221222c,"now speak, would occasion much discouragement of the fabrication of manufactures. "
241,r221222c,"(Thornton 1978, pp. 118-19) "
242,r221222c,"Thornton, like Hume, notes that the reason the diminution of money affects employment is "
243,r221222c,the rigidity of money wage contracts. He believes that if wages fall to the extent that prices 
244,r221222c,"do  at  the  same  time,  there  will  be  no  effect  on  employment.  However,  because  there  is "
245,r221222c,"downward  rigidity  in  the  rate  of  wages,  a  fall  in  prices  will  affect  the  real  economy.  His "
246,r221222c,"depiction of this influence, as well as his use of the term ""industry"" in the following quote, is "
247,r221222c,reminiscent of Hume. 
248,r221222c,13  Hicks (1967b) relates this tendency to Keynes's liquidity preference theory. 
249,r221222c,9 
250,r221222c,                                                              A great diminution of notes prevents much of that industry of the country which had 
251,r221222c,been exerted from being so productive as it would otherwise be. When a time either of 
252,r221222c,"multiplied failures, or even of much disappointment in the expected means of effecting "
253,r221222c,"payments  arises,  plans  of  commerce  and  manufacture,  as  well  as  of  general "
254,r221222c,"improvement of every kind, which had been entered upon, are changed or suspended, "
255,r221222c,"and part of the labour which had been bestowed proves, therefore, to have been thrown "
256,r221222c,away. . . . The goods which ought to form part of the assortment of the factor or the 
257,r221222c,"shopkeeper,  and  to  be  occupying  their  premises,  are  loading  the  warehouse  of  the "
258,r221222c,"manufacturer, and, perhaps, are suffering damage by too long detention. On the other "
259,r221222c,"hand,  some  sales  are  forced;  and  thus  the  goods  prepared  for  one  market,  and  best "
260,r221222c,"suited to it, are sold at another. There cease, at such a time, to be that regularity and "
261,r221222c,"exactness  in  proportioning  and  adapting  the  supply  to  the  consumption,  and  that "
262,r221222c,"dispatch  in  bringing  every  article  from  the  hands  of  the  fabricator  into  actual  use, "
263,r221222c,"which are some of the great means of rendering industry productive, and of adding to "
264,r221222c,the general substance of a country. Every great and sudden check given to paper credit 
265,r221222c,"not only operates as a check to industry, but leads also to much of this misapplication "
266,r221222c,"of it. (Thornton 1978, pp. 119-21) "
267,r221222c,Thornton does not mention the long-term effects of such a check to and misapplication of 
268,r221222c,"industry.  Nor  did  Thornton  himself  consider  inflation  preferable  to  deflation.  However, "
269,r221222c,fluctuations in the quantity of money are clearly undesirable as they have a negative impact 
270,r221222c,"on the real economy, at least in the short run. "
271,r221222c,"In  relation  to  Thornton's  second  accomplishment,  the  extent  to  which  manufacturers  and "
272,r221222c,merchants receive bank loans is determined by the relationship between their expected profit 
273,r221222c,rates and market interest rates. If the market interest rate is lower than the rate of expected 
274,r221222c,"profit, bank lending will increase, the quantity of money will increase, and prices will rise. "
275,r221222c,"On the other hand, if the market interest rate is higher than the rate of expected profit, bank "
276,r221222c,"lending  will  decrease,  the  quantity  of  money  will  decrease,  and  prices  will  fall. Thornton "
277,r221222c,"distinguishes between nominal and real interest rates, taking into account changes in inflation "
278,r221222c,10 
279,r221222c,        expectations.14  His account of changes in inflation expectations was later taken up by Irving 
280,r221222c,"Fisher, while his two-interest-rate analysis was later adopted by Knut Wicksell; both form the "
281,r221222c,theoretical basis of modern macroeconomics. 
282,r221222c,"This  brings  us  to  Thornton's  third  accomplishment,  which  is  an  inquiry  into  the  policy "
283,r221222c,"responses of central banks. At the time of the Bank Restriction Period, the BOE did not see "
284,r221222c,"itself as a central bank. Thornton argued that it should act as one. First, he stated that central "
285,r221222c,banks should act to stabilize price fluctuations by setting market interest rates consistent with 
286,r221222c,"expected  profit rates. Then,  as Walter  Bagehot  would  later emphasize, they  should  supply "
287,r221222c,"liquidity in times of financial crisis. When a financial crunch occurs, people's demand for "
288,r221222c,"money surges, giving rise to moves to withdraw money from the banking system. At such a "
289,r221222c,"time, it would be reasonable for an individual bank to simply reduce lending, but if all banks "
290,r221222c,"were  to  act  in  the  same  way,  lending  in  the  economy  as  a  whole  would  dwindle  further. "
291,r221222c,"Thornton argued that, in times of a financial crunch, the BOE should rather provide liquidity "
292,r221222c,to the economy by lending generously. 
293,r221222c,C. Subsequent Developments 
294,r221222c,"Since I have discussed subsequent developments elsewhere, here I will touch on topics related "
295,r221222c,to our current context.15  Thornton was concerned about deflation but thought it would last 
296,r221222c,"only  for  the  short  run.  However,  the  time  came  when  Europe  was  exposed  to  prolonged "
297,r221222c,deflationary pressure. The question as to whether the mild deflation seen at the end of the 
298,r221222c,19th century -- lasting from 1873 to 1896 -- had an impact on the real economy remains a 
299,r221222c,"matter  of  debate.  Some  argue  that  at  that  time  it  was  ""good  deflation""  under  which "
300,r221222c,"productivity  improved,  while  others  focus  on  the  adjustment  capability  of  the  economic "
301,r221222c,"structure of the 19th century, where labor and product markets were flexible. However, some "
302,r221222c,"recent studies have shown that, after correcting for errors in the measurement of price data, "
303,r221222c,"14  Thornton  (1978,  pp.  335-36)  made this distinction  in  his speech to  the  UK  Parliament  in  1811.  According to Humphrey (1983), William Douglass -- born in Scotland in the 18th century -- was the  first to distinguish between real and nominal interest rates.  15  See Wakatabe (2009, 2015, 2017). "
304,r221222c,11 
305,r221222c,                                                            the deflation had a negative impact on the real economy (Kaufmann 2020).16 
306,r221222c,It  was  during  this  period  that  the  quantity  theory  of  money  evolved  into  the  supply  and 
307,r221222c,"demand theory of money advanced by Alfred Marshall, as well as by Fisher and Wicksell. In "
308,r221222c,"essence, the theory parallels the innovation in economics that occurred around the same time, "
309,r221222c,"known as the marginal revolution, and is closely related to the full-fledged application of the "
310,r221222c,supply  and  demand  theory  to  pricing  goods  and  services. 17   Wicksell  explored  ways  of 
311,r221222c,"defining the natural rate of interest, but took this to mean a long-term rather than a short-term "
312,r221222c,interest rate.18   
313,r221222c,"The  Great  Depression  of  the  1930s  was  accompanied  by  severe  deflation.  At  this  time, "
314,r221222c,monetary economics made great strides forward and the field of macroeconomics was born. 
315,r221222c,John  Maynard  Keynes's  innovation  lay  in  constructing  a  principle  of  effective  demand.  I 
316,r221222c,"should note that, whereas the most successful interpretation of Keynes, the IS-LM model, "
317,r221222c,"assumes the rigidity of wages and prices, Keynes himself did not premise his ideas on wage "
318,r221222c,"or price rigidity. He sought to argue that the more flexible wages and prices are, the more "
319,r221222c,unstable the economy becomes.19   
320,r221222c,Elevated inflation came on the scene in the 1970s.20  This is the period when Milton Friedman 
321,r221222c,"and the monetarist school of economics took the world by storm. However, Friedman's work "
322,r221222c,in economics is really an extension of Keynesian economics. The well-known equation for 
323,r221222c,"the quantity theory of money is MV = PQ, where M is quantity of money, V is velocity of "
324,r221222c,"money, P is price level, and Q is quantity of real output, and PQ on the right-hand side of the "
325,r221222c,equation reflects nominal GDP. It is also possible to regard the left-hand side as corresponding 
326,r221222c,"16  Fischer (1996) considered that the deflationary period started much earlier and characterized the  period  from  the  1820s  to  the  1890s  as  the  ""Victorian  equilibrium.""  See  Cameron's  (1997)  critical  review of Fischer's argument. See also Wakatabe (2013, pp. 255-59).  17  See Laidler (1991). Edgeworth's (1888) paper served as another important discussion of the time  regarding the basic theory of central banks.  18  As Rogoff, Rossi, and Schmelzing (2022, p. 8n9) argue, Wicksell's definition of the natural rate of  interest is an economy-wide average concept encompassing both short- and long-term interest rates.  19  His  hypothesis  was  later  followed  by  the  construction  of  disequilibrium  economic  theory,  but  remains unproved.  20  With regard to the Great Inflation of the 1970s, see Wakatabe (2022).   "
327,r221222c,12 
328,r221222c,                                                              to money supply and the right-hand side as corresponding to money demand. If we assume 
329,r221222c,"the  causality  from  money  supply,  Friedman's  argument  is  that  money  supply  determines "
330,r221222c,"nominal  GDP.  For  changes  in  nominal  GDP,  the  extent  to  which  either  the  price  level  or "
331,r221222c,quantity of real output changes depends on the shape of the aggregate supply curve. If real 
332,r221222c,"output were constant, a change in M would cause only prices to change. However, real output "
333,r221222c,"is not necessarily constant. Although the neutrality of money holds in the long run, the short-"
334,r221222c,run non-neutrality of money is an understanding inherited from the classical school. 
335,r221222c,Of key relevance to the contemporary debate is Friedman's argument that cost-push factors 
336,r221222c,do not lead to sustained inflation. 
337,r221222c,It is essential to distinguish changes in relative prices from changes in absolute prices. 
338,r221222c,The special conditions that drove up the prices of oil and food required purchasers to 
339,r221222c,"spend more on them, leaving less to spend on other items. Did that not force other "
340,r221222c,prices to go down or to rise less rapidly than otherwise? Why should the average level 
341,r221222c,of all prices be affected significantly by changes in the prices of some things relative 
342,r221222c,"to others? Thanks to delays in adjustment, the rapid rises in oil and food prices may "
343,r221222c,"have temporarily raised the rate of inflation somewhat. . . . [H]owever, . . . the basic "
344,r221222c,source  of  inflation  is  the  faster  growth  in  the  quantity  of  money  than  in  output. 
345,r221222c,(Friedman 1974)21 
346,r221222c,"Another area that came to draw attention during this period was the role of ""expectations"" in "
347,r221222c,economics.  Inflation  expectations  rather  than  exogenous  cost-push  factors  contribute  to 
348,r221222c,sustained inflation. Reining in the Great Inflation called for subduing inflation expectations. 
349,r221222c,"Although  this  stress  on  expectations  is  particularly  tied  in  with  the  ""rational  expectations "
350,r221222c,"revolution"" associated with Robert E. Lucas Jr. and Thomas J. Sargent, among others, the "
351,r221222c,"concept of expectations has been taken up throughout the history of monetary economics, "
352,r221222c,with different theorists approaching it differently. There was also a growing awareness that 
353,r221222c,monetary policy plays an important role in stabilizing inflation expectations to bring about 
354,r221222c,"price stability. Inflation targeting, which is the monetary policy framework now adopted by "
355,r221222c,"21  See also Kakino (2019, p. 93). "
356,r221222c,13 
357,r221222c,"                                                              central banks in many countries, was born out of lessons learned from the Great Inflation of "
358,r221222c,the  1970s.  This  awareness  spread  gradually  through  both  academic  and  central  banking 
359,r221222c,"circles  and  is  still  widely  shared  today,  having  been  further  shaped  by  the  experience  of "
360,r221222c,"stagnation accompanied by prolonged deflation in Japan starting in the late 1990s, the Global "
361,r221222c,"Financial  Crisis  (GFC)  of  the  2000s  and  responses  to  the  subsequent  recession,  and  by "
362,r221222c,responses to the COVID-19 pandemic starting in 2020. 
363,r221222c,III. Looking Ahead: Lessons from History 
364,r221222c,"Finally, I will consider future monetary policy in light of history. I would first like to consider "
365,r221222c,future economic and financial conditions. 
366,r221222c,A.  Implications  from  History  for  Future  Economic  and  Financial  Conditions  and 
367,r221222c,Monetary Policy 
368,r221222c,"JordaÃÄ et al. (2019) demonstrated that, for 16 countries including Japan from 1870 to 2015, "
369,r221222c,"the  following  relationship  between  the  real  rate  of  return  on  safe  assets  (rsafe),  the  real "
370,r221222c,"economic  growth  rate  (g),  and  the  real  rate  of  return  on  aggregate  wealth  (rwealth)  held "
371,r221222c,approximately true: 
372,r221222c,rsafe < g < rwealth. 
373,r221222c,This relationship can be understood intuitively. Safe assets have the lowest rate of return. This 
374,r221222c,is followed by the rate of return on the aggregate flow of goods and services in the economy. 
375,r221222c,"The rate of return on all assets, including risk assets, is the highest. Three further relationships "
376,r221222c,follow from this. 
377,r221222c,"First, except for the interwar period and the period between the Great Inflation and around "
378,r221222c,"the 2000s, rsafe < g held true. Although g reached the 4 percent range during the high-growth "
379,r221222c,"period following World War II, it fell to the 2 percent range in the 1970s. It then declined "
380,r221222c,"further with the onset of the GFC in the 2000s, but has recently remained at around 2 percent. "
381,r221222c,It can also be said that there is no empirical correlation between the economic growth rate 
382,r221222c,and real interest rates.22 
383,r221222c,"22  Rogoff, Rossi, and Schmelzing (2022) also did not find any clear correlation between global long- maturity real interest rates and the real economic growth rate. "
384,r221222c,14 
385,r221222c,"                                                              In a similar vein, what about developments in the natural rate of interest? While there are "
386,r221222c,"various  estimates  of  the  natural  rate  of  interest,  one  way  to  look  at  it  is  to  analyze "
387,r221222c,"developments in real interest rates. According to Schmelzing (2020), global real interest rates "
388,r221222c,have historically been on a downtrend (Chart 8).23 
389,r221222c,"Second,  except  for  the  period  of  the  two  world  wars,  g  <  rwealth  held  true. Although  the "
390,r221222c,"decrease in g and the increase in rwealth both contributed to the gap between the two figures, "
391,r221222c,the increase in rwealth is taken to have made a larger contribution. 
392,r221222c,"Third, except for limited periods, rsafe < rwealth held true. The gap between the two is equivalent "
393,r221222c,"to  risk  premia,  but  this  gap  has  been  shrinking  in  recent  years.  Under  the  Bretton Woods "
394,r221222c,"system, while rsafe was low, rwealth was high, driven upward by housing returns. However, rwealth "
395,r221222c,has been declining in recent years. 
396,r221222c,What are the implications for future monetary policy if the above relationships continue to 
397,r221222c,hold? 
398,r221222c,"First, if the natural rate of interest continues on a declining trend, the challenge for central "
399,r221222c,banks' monetary policy will continue to be how to lower real interest rates in an effective 
400,r221222c,"manner. Faced with the zero lower bound (ZLB) in an era of low inflation, central banks have "
401,r221222c,taken steps to boost the effectiveness of their monetary policy. Various proposals have been 
402,r221222c,"made to improve policy objectives (Chart 9). As a result, central banks have reaffirmed the "
403,r221222c,"importance of committing to the 2 percent inflation target. With regard to policy measures, "
404,r221222c,"the Bank of Japan, for example, has introduced such measures as quantitative easing, negative "
405,r221222c,"interest rates, diversification of asset purchasing, yield curve control, and forward guidance. "
406,r221222c,"The  necessity  for  policy  innovation  to  boost  the  effectiveness  of  monetary  policy,  both  in "
407,r221222c,"terms of policy objectives and measures, may increase; it certainly will not diminish.24 "
408,r221222c,"23  Due to data limitations, global real interest rates in this study were calculated from GDP-weighted  nominal interest rates and inflation rates using available data for eight countries: Italy, the Netherlands,  France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States, and Japan. Since the study does not  take into account the recent rise of China and emerging economies, the possibility of underestimation  warrants attention.  24  Bernanke (2022, pp. 330-65) elaborates on this point. "
409,r221222c,15 
410,r221222c,"                                                                Second,  if  g  <  rwealth,  this  implies  that  the  uptrend  in  the  ratio  of  total  assets  to  GDP  will "
411,r221222c,"continue. If there is a certain positive correlation between total assets and total liabilities, this "
412,r221222c,means that the ratio of total liabilities to GDP will also trend upward. This in turn means that 
413,r221222c,asset price fluctuations will have a growing impact on the economy through asset (liability) 
414,r221222c,balances. 
415,r221222c,"Third, decreasing risk premia can lead to the underpricing of risks. Krishnamurthy and Muir "
416,r221222c,(2017)  argue  that  financial  crises  frequently  occur  when  risk  premia  shrink  and  risk  is 
417,r221222c,underpriced.  Central  banks  will  increasingly  need  to  prepare  macroprudential  policies  to 
418,r221222c,maintain stability in the financial system. 
419,r221222c,The above considerations are based on history and past trends. Should these trends change 
420,r221222c,"significantly, my conclusions will also change. We cannot rule out the possibility that such "
421,r221222c,"major changes will occur in the future. However, as I said earlier in section I., it is uncertain "
422,r221222c,"whether the natural rate of interest will rise as a trend in the future. On the contrary, we cannot "
423,r221222c,deny the possibility of an ongoing decline in the natural rate of interest. What history over 
424,r221222c,"the long term makes apparent is that the mild-inflation regime has not come to an end, and "
425,r221222c,we should say that the potential dangers of secular stagnation and Japanification have not yet 
426,r221222c,passed. 
427,r221222c,B.  Introduction  and Achievements  of  Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Monetary  Easing 
428,r221222c,(QQE) 
429,r221222c,"There is no need for pessimism, however, even during periods of Japanification. Having long "
430,r221222c,"been mired in deflation, the policy change made in Japan with the introduction of QQE in "
431,r221222c,"April 2013 has produced positive effects. Even before its introduction, economic growth had "
432,r221222c,"been  achieved  despite  the  declining  labor  force  population,  but  the  GDP  growth  rate  has "
433,r221222c,"improved and prices have risen clearly since 2013, as the unemployment rate declined and "
434,r221222c,the number of employed persons increased (Charts 10 and 11). The overall GDP growth rate 
435,r221222c,"has been low because the labor force population has been declining; however, if we look at "
436,r221222c,"the real GDP growth rate per capita, which takes into account changes in the employment rate "
437,r221222c,"over time, we see that, while the rate was at 0.4 percent in the 2000s, it recovered to the 1990s "
438,r221222c,level of 1.3 percent in the 2010s (Chart 12). This suggests that there was a rise in productivity 
439,r221222c,16 
440,r221222c,          per worker and in the labor force participation rate. Improved employment conditions led to 
441,r221222c,an increase in the employment rate for new graduates and ended the so-called employment 
442,r221222c,"ice  age.  Of  course,  providing  support  for  those  who  struggled  to  find  jobs  during  the "
443,r221222c,employment ice age remains a crucial task. In order to create an environment that can provide 
444,r221222c,"employment  opportunities  for  this  generation,  it  is  important  to  maintain  a  high-pressure "
445,r221222c,"economy. While the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items "
446,r221222c,"less fresh food) was on average minus 0.3 percent between fiscal 1998 and fiscal 2012, the "
447,r221222c,average rate from fiscal 2013 onward rose to 0.4 percent (Chart 13). Although it is true that 
448,r221222c,"the price stability target of 2 percent has not yet been achieved, we are now in a situation "
449,r221222c,"where the economy is no longer in deflation, in the sense of a sustained decline in prices.25 "
450,r221222c,These improvements in economic activity and prices were made following the adoption of 
451,r221222c,the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent  in  2013.  Japan's  economy  was  in  deflation  for  a 
452,r221222c,"prolonged period, but sustainable monetary easing certainly had positive effects on the real "
453,r221222c,"economy. Consequently, it can be said that this provides evidence that QQE supports the idea "
454,r221222c,of a high-pressure economy. 
455,r221222c,Conclusion 
456,r221222c,"Today,  I  considered  the  narrative  that,  with  the  end  of  the  mild-inflationary  regime "
457,r221222c,"accompanied by anxiety over deflation, concern about secular stagnation and Japanification "
458,r221222c,"has passed into history, and that a regime of high inflation will emerge. Against this narrative, "
459,r221222c,I have argued that the threat of secular stagnation and Japanification has not yet been dispelled 
460,r221222c,"completely. This is because cost-push factors, real factors, and changes in the natural rate of "
461,r221222c,interest  --  the  factors  that  are  usually  pointed  out  --  do  not  necessarily  suggest  sustained 
462,r221222c,"inflation;  rather,  it  is  important  to  take  monetary  factors  into  consideration  to  determine "
463,r221222c,whether inflation will be sustainable. 
464,r221222c,"As Hicks's words introduced at the beginning of the speech indicate, the field of monetary "
465,r221222c,economics  has  changed  over  time  in  accordance  with  actual  economic  and  financial 
466,r221222c,"developments. After having experienced price fluctuations, monetary economics has become "
467,r221222c,"increasingly aware of the importance of price stability. Moreover, not only have there been "
468,r221222c,"25  For details of the relationship between wages and prices, see section II. B. in Wakatabe (2022). "
469,r221222c,17 
470,r221222c,                                                              persistent so-called inflation fears but also deflation fears. While the quantity theory of money 
471,r221222c,is commonly characterized by its argument for the short-run non-neutrality of money and the 
472,r221222c,"long-run neutrality of money, the possibility of money being non-neutral in the long run has "
473,r221222c,also been pointed out since the theory was first developed. This reflects the fact that prices 
474,r221222c,"are not completely adjusted in markets. Later, with the growth of the credit economy, two-"
475,r221222c,interest-rate analysis was developed. As the divergence between the two interest rates will 
476,r221222c,"not automatically be adjusted under the fiat money system, the role of the central bank as the "
477,r221222c,issuer of money is essential in order to ensure price stability. 
478,r221222c,"The  current  model  of  monetary  economics  may  need  to  be  changed,  depending  on  future "
479,r221222c,"circumstances. That said, the lessons learned from history are that it is monetary factors that "
480,r221222c,are  important  in  determining  whether  an  economy  is  being  subject  to  inflationary  or 
481,r221222c,"deflationary pressure, and that monetary policy conducted by central banks will play a vital "
482,r221222c,role since it controls the quantity of money. 
483,r221222c,Japan's experience of prolonged deflation suggests that it takes a great deal of effort to dispel 
484,r221222c,"anxiety  over  deflation.  Nevertheless,  there  was  no  need  to  give  up  the  challenge  of "
485,r221222c,overcoming deflation simply because the economy fell into deflation; against the background 
486,r221222c,"of the Bank's monetary policy measures adopted since 2013, the economy has improved and "
487,r221222c,"is currently no longer in deflation. That said, Japan's experience has raised questions about a "
488,r221222c,"number of dichotomies in economics: nominal and real values, the short term and long term, "
489,r221222c,and the business cycle and economic growth. I believe that there is still a lot to be learned 
490,r221222c,"regarding these issues, both theoretically and empirically. In this sense, monetary economics "
491,r221222c,"is  still  in  the  process  of  development,  and  the  questions  raised  by  Hume  are  still  under "
492,r221222c,debate.26 
493,r221222c,Thank you. 
494,r221222c,"26  JordaÃÄ, Singh, and Taylor (2020) highlight the hysteresis effects of monetary policy on capital and  technology.  Kurozumi  and  Van  Zandweghe  (2022)  point  to  the  possibility  that  the  optimal  policy  response will differ depending on changes in labor force participation rates. "
