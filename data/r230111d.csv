3,r230111d,"Governors, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. It is a pleasure and great  honor for me to be welcoming so many distinguished members of the central bank  community to Thailand. Thank you for making the journey here from near and afar. Let  me also extend a warm welcome to speakers and panelists joining us on-line today. We  truly appreciate your participation in the conference. I would like to also express my  sincere appreciation to the BIS for helping usorganize and host this event. During a  period where the world is grappling with challenges that threaten to pull us apart, the  BIS has continued to serve as a cornerstone of central bank and regulatory cooperation  acting to pull us together. Indeed we are all here together in large part due to the  convening powers of the BIS."

5,r230111d,"This year marks the 80th anniversary of the Bank of Thailand. This conference is  an opportune moment for us to take stock and reflect on how far we have come and  chart the way forward. In light of the rapid and seismic changes we have experienced,  such reflection is needed more so now than ever. Today, central banks are facing a  triple challenge from: i)  the nature of the underlying policy challenge; ii)  needed to guide policy; and iii)  mandates and central bank independence. In other words, what needs to be done has  changed, how to do it has become unclear, and why it should be done is subject to  greater scrutiny. For central banks tasked with maintainingeconomic and financial  stability, it is as if the ground is literally shifting beneath our feet. Hence the theme of  the conference today: ""Central Banking Amidst Shifting Ground""."

9,r230111d,"We are exceptionally fortunate to have such a distinguished list of speakers and  panelists with us to share their insights and experiences on these issues. To set the  stage, let me elaborate on the three key fault lines that central banks will have to  navigate at this critical juncture. "
10,r230111d,A rapidly changing economic backdrop
11,r230111d,"The first fault line, reflecting the rapidly changing economic backdrop, is  palpable. Inflation has returned with a vengeance, catching everyone by surprise. The  strong post-pandemic rebound in global aggregate demand combined with a large  rotation of that demand from services to goods put huge pressure on global supply  chains, which was unable to respond. This was compounded by a surge in commodity  prices in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war. Supply constraints have clearly taken  prominence deeper level, secular trends in globalization and demographics that have hitherto  created a powerful tailwind, expanding production possibilities and generating  persistent disinflationary pressures, may also be turning. Increasing fragmentation "

16,r230111d,"In a nutshell, the economic backdrop facing central banks has shifted from one of  insufficient demand to insufficient supply . The challenge of inflation being too low  has turned to inflation being too high. For monetary policy, the constraint on achieving  inflation targets has shifted from the zero-lower-bound to the inability to influence  inelastic supply. Calibrating and communicating policy under this new landscape will be  very different than before, as we have already seen."
17,r230111d,the financial system is also evolving
18,r230111d,"In parallel,  , and with it the risks and pressure  points that central banks need to address. The greater prominence of the financial  , both domestically and globally, has transformed the nature of economic  cycle fluctuations, linking them more to swings in funding conditions, asset prices and risk- taking. The increased role of non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) has also  created new potential vulnerabilities lagged behind those of banks. Indeed strains in the NBFI sector were at the heart of  financial stress during the Covid-19 crisis, as well as recent tensions in sovereign debt  markets. Finally, advancements in cryptography and distributed-ledger technology  have led to a proliferation of digital assets and tokens , some of which circulate in  parallel infrastructure outside of regulatory control and oversight. It has also spurred a  concerted effort by central banks to harness these new technologies, through CBDCs  and other initiatives, in order to ensure that central bank money remains fit-for- purpose in a digitalized monetary system."

22,r230111d, Facts on the ground are increasingly testing long-standing analytical 
23,r230111d,"Most prominently, the recent surge in inflation has upended the Phillips curve as  a model of inflation. The supposedly low sensitivity of inflation to measures of slack,  or in other words the flat Phillips curve, turned out to be anything but low; the lack of  any internal persistence generating mechanism implies that the framework underplays  the possibility of wage-price spirals, and the assumed independence of structural  parameters to the level of inflation rules out self-reinforcing transitions from low to high  inflation regimes â€“ a very real danger that central banks are grappling with. The upshot  has been a systematic underprediction of inflation. model of the inflation process: one that can capture how relative price shocks translate  into persistent price movements as well as non-linearities in expectations and cost pass- through."

25,r230111d,"At the same time, there has been a need to fundamentally rethink conceptual  frameworks and approaches to financial regulation.  The rapid digitalization of trade  and finance has transformed the nature of financial services, the types entities offering  them, and the location from which they are being offered. Borders and dividing lines are   Meanwhile the  being eroded, creating potentially "

How best to foster innovative solutions while  safeguarding stability, ensuring fair competition and market contestability, and providing  adequate consumer protection? What is the appropriate balance and combination  between entity-based and activity-based regulation? How does this relate to the  application of micro-versus macro-prudential regulation? Moreover, we also need to  consider how best to gear regulation to facilitate the green transition that is so critical.   as we grapple with  Our  these complex regulatory challenges."

31,r230111d,The climate challenge
32,r230111d,"The third and final fault line is climate change and central banks' role in  combating it. Of all the three challenges, this is arguably the most daunting one. It is  new to us. There is no precedence to follow. And the outcome is not under our direct  influence, testing the limits of our tools. Yet we cannot ignore it. Given the potential  consequences, combatting climate change is simply too urgent and too important.  Unlike inflation, where falling behind the curve would entail a degree of pain down the  road when policy eventually needs to catch up, there is no catching up if we fall  behind the curve on climate change. getting it wrong would be catastrophic."

The most impactful channel for  central banks in this respect is through the expertise in the financial sector must be geared so as to ensure that sufficient  resources become available to finance the green transition. This requires a  collaborative approach , both among agencies within a country, as well as  internationally.
